          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>HackHolyoke is a 24-hour hackathon run by students at Mount Holyoke College. This year’s event will take place digitally on November 6-7, 2020, so you can hack and attend workshops from wherever you may be! We set ourselves apart by striving for (and consistently achieving!) a 1:1 gender ratio and welcoming college student hackers from all levels. Our aim is to shatter any misconceptions about STEM fields and to celebrate diversity in these fields through creating an inclusive environment for anyone regardless of gender, racial, or academic background.

            Students will have the opportunity to create amazing projects and showcase their work to a panel of judges. Participants can attend inspiring talks and innovative workshops, join in on fun activities like midnight Zumba, and have the chance to win exclusive prizes.

                <li><b>What is a Hackathon?</b></li>
                <p>
                  An event in which participants spend a condensed period of time (usually somewhere between 24 and 36 hours) working on a project, attending workshops, networking, and generally having a good time. At the end, the participants can present what they have worked on to judges to win prizes.

                <li><b>I don’t have coding experience, can I still participate?</b></li>
                <p>
                  Absolutely! We welcome everyone with a passion for learning and a can-do attitude. For people with limited or no coding experience who want to learn more, we will also have beginner-friendly workshops.

                  If you’re interested in hacking with us you can register here <insert link>. This year’s hackathon will be digital, so all you will need is your computer and an internet connection.

                <li><b>Do I need a team to participate?</b></li>
                <p>
                  You do not need a team to participate. While we encourage people to work in teams, hackers are perfectly welcome to go solo. If you want a team, but don’t have one, yet, sign up and we will help you find a team at the start of the event!
